    "review" : "Probably one of the best beef tartare in the world. Super fresh and juicy. You can just tell that after one bite. The beef burger was also heavenly. Tiny, but efficient with a few chairs inside. I would definitely go back to Naše maso one day to grab some more."

    "review" : "햄버거 패티 진짜 환상적이네요. 패티가 그냥 스테이크마냥 녹아요 ㄷㄷ 생각보다 자극적이지 않아서 패스트푸드 보다는 수제햄버거 느낌이구요. 재료 추가하면 비싸지는 대신 더 맛있어요. 생맥주도 팔아서 같이 먹는 것도 좋을듯 ㅎㅎ"
